# Sentiment_analysis_NLP

A Sentiment Analysis is a Machine Learning Algorithm, used in a sphere of Natural Language Processing to determine the attitude of a speaker or a writer with respect to some topic or the overall contextual polarity of a document. The attitude may be his or her judgment or evaluation, affective state (emotional state of the author when writing), or the intended emotional communication (the emotional effect the author wishes to have on the reader).

Sentiment Analysis is widely applied to review social media in a variety of applications (e.g.marketing, customer service, etc.).

The project includes the following:
- Explanation of the tasks.pdf - which explains the aim of the project and describes the overall algorithm
- AFINN-111.txt and AFINN-README.txt files - which provides the idea about an AFINN dataset and includes the dataset itself, which is used in the Sentiment Analysis
- stop-words_english from 1 to 6.txt - a set of stop words, which are common in Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications
- Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb - a project itself, done in Jupyter Notebook
