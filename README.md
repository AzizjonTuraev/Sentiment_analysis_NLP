# Sentiment_analysis_NLP

A sentiment analysis determines the attitude of a speaker or a writer with respect to some topic or the overall contextual polarity of a document. The attitude may be his or her judgment or evaluation, affective state (emotional state of the author when writing), or the intended emotional communication (the emotional effect the author wishes to have on the reader).
